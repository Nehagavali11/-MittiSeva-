# Project Logbook

📅 Date: 13th Feb 2025 

✅ Finalized Topic:

Decided on the project title: "Sustainable Fertilizer Usage Optimizer for Higher Yield."

The project will focus on optimizing fertilizer usage based on soil conditions to improve crop yield while minimizing environmental impact.


📅 Date: 17th Feb 2025

✅ Collected Dataset :

Explored various sources such as Kaggle, ICAR, and FAO for soil and fertilizer data.
Decided to use a mix of existing datasets and custom data collection.
Structured the dataset with essential features:
Soil pH, Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Moisture (%), Crop Type, and Recommended Fertilizer (kg).

✅ Introduction :

Agriculture plays a crucial role in global food security and economic stability. However, improper fertilizer usage—either excessive or insufficient—leads to soil degradation, low crop yield, and environmental pollution. Traditional farming methods rely on generalized fertilizer application, often ignoring soil health, nutrient requirements, and crop-specific needs.

Our project, Sustainable Fertilizer Usage Optimizer for Higher Yield, aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to recommend optimal fertilizer usage based on soil properties. By analyzing key factors like soil pH, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and moisture levels, our system provides data-driven insights for farmers to enhance productivity while minimizing environmental impact.

Key Features :

✅ Smart Fertilizer Recommendations based on real-time soil data 📊

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights into soil health 🔍

✅ AI/ML Model to optimize fertilizer application 🤖

✅ User-friendly Dashboard for farmers to access recommendations 💻
